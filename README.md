# User Experience

## Design Choices
* ### Tipography
  * The font chosen were 'Rajdhani' for the heading and for the body text. It falls back to sans-serif respectively.
* ## Colour Scheme 
  * The colour scheme eventually chosen is based on pink/salmon and off-white. The colour contrasts with the fruits colour in many of the images. Pink traditionally gives the impression of woman, sweet and empowerment. This is something that Healthy Sugar Club can hopefully pass onto the user.

# Acknowledgements
The website was built for my first project of my course from Code Institute. I would like to gratefully thank my mentor Precious Ijege for helping through the steps of this project, he guided me along and helped me in every single step. Would also like to thank the tutors from Code Institute who helped me so much throughout these weeks with every doubt i had. Everyone is so patience and competent. 
Healthy Sugar Club is a fictional community, but i still would encourage everyone to follow this path for a better life.
